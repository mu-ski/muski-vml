## Architecture

This project will use the [Clean / Hexagonal](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) architectural pattern in the sense of having one-way dependancies from the outside components to the core/model component, and using adapters and ports to exchange data across layers.

Below are the main components:

![architecture](https://github.com/n42r/virtmulib/blob/main/docs/arch.drawio.svg?raw=true)

- Domain Model: the core models/data objects which are a list of tracks, collections, users
- Onloader: loads user data (music library, liked, tracks, etc) from external services
- Curator: LLM-powered component to create playlists. I discuss with the user their music taste / interests and generates a playlist
- Offloader: Links items in the intenal Virtual Music Library of the user (typically a newly generated plalyist) to external services where the music can be heard
